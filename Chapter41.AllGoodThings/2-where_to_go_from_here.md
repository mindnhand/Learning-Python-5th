# Where to Go From Here
And that's a wrap, folks. You've officially reached the end of this book. Now that you know Python inside and out, your next step, should you choose to take it, is to explore the libraries, techniques, and tools available in the application domains in which you work.

Because Python is so widely used, you'll find ample resources for using it in almost any application you can think of -- from GUIs, the Web, and databases to numeric programming, robotics, and system administration. See Chapter 1 and your favorite web browser for pointers to popular tools and topics.

This is where Python starts to become truly fun, but this is also where this book's story ends, and others' begin. For pointers on where to turn after this book, see the recommended follow-up texts mentioned in the preface. I hope to see you in an applications programming domain soon.

Good luck with your journey. And of course, "Always look on the bright side of Life!"
