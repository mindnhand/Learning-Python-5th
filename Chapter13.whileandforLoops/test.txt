In general, loops come in handy anywhere you need to repeat an operation or process
something more than once. Because files contain multiple characters and lines, they are
one of the more typical use cases for loops. To load a file’s contents into a string all at
once, you simply call the file object’s read method:
file = open('test.txt', 'r') # Read contents into a string
print(file.read())
